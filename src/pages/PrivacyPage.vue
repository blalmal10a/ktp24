            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                This privacy policy explains how our organization songbook application
                ("App") treats your privacy.
            </p>

            <h2>What We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                Our App currently does not collect any personal data from you. You can use
                the App without providing any information that could identify you.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                Our App integrates with third-party services like Google Ads to display
                advertisements. These third-party services may use cookies, pixel tags, or
                other technologies to collect information about your activity on the App
                and across other websites. This information is used to deliver targeted
                advertising to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>We do not control the collection or use of data by these third-party
                    services.</strong>
                Please refer to the privacy policies of these third-party services to
                learn more about their practices. You may be able to opt-out of receiving
                targeted advertising from certain ad networks.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Choices</h2>
            <p>
                Because we do not collect any personal data ourselves, you cannot directly
                control what data is collected through third-party cookies. However, you
                can adjust your browser settings to block or delete cookies altogether, or
                you may be able to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from certain
                ad networks through their websites.
            </p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                While we strive to protect your privacy, no data transmission over the
                internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot warrant the
                security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own
                risk.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of
                any changes by posting the new privacy policy on the App.
